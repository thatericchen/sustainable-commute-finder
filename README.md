# Sustainable Commute Finder

## Introduction
Sustainable Commute Finder is a comprehensive web app designed to help users make informed, eco-friendly commuting decisions. By integrating interactive maps, carbon footprint estimations, and dynamic transportation options, the app empowers users to compare various travel modes and select the most sustainable routes. This project combines modern web technologies (Vite, React, Spring Boot) with a robust MongoDB backend and GCP deployment pipeline to deliver a seamless, user-friendly experience. It is built with a commitment to environmental consciousness, aiming to educate and encourage users to choose greener transportation options and reduce their carbon footprints.

## Install Guide
### Prerequisite Installations
- Maven
- Java 17
- GCP
- MongoDB 7.0

### GCP instruction and MongoDB Configuration
#### GCP Setup
Download Google Cloud CLI for your respective OS and run the script to install it.
- GCP credit application
- Make sure billing information is set up
- Create a new project

Navigate to Google Cloud Console and create a Spring Boot Application.
- Navigate to https://start.spring.io/
  - Project: Maven
  - Packaging: jar
  - Java: 17
  - Add the Spring Web dependency and click generate

- Package the Maven Build: To test and get development server running, we will need maven.
  - If there is a path variable defined for maven run
    - `mvn clean install`
  - If no path variable, macOS can run
    - `./mvnw clean install`
  - Windows can run
    - `./mvnw.cmd clean install`
  - These are the packages the maven builds into a JAR file in the target directory which we will use to deploy onto GCP.

Deploy to GCP
- Run `gcloud -v` to make sure the Google Cloud CLI is installed.
- Run `gcloud init` to initialize google cloud.
- Make sure to choose the default configuration.
- You will then be prompted to login with your email (make sure to use the email that has billing set up with the credits provided).

#### Database Setup
- MongoDB
  - Set the url to the MongoDB in environment variable, and we set this auto_create_database connect with GCP, and set up the authentication with GCP, then create a admin role, and we get this url:`spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://adminUser:yourSecurePassword@127.0.0.1:27017/accounts`, replacing `<adminUser>`, `<yourSecurePassword>`, and `<127.0.0.1:27017>` with your IP range.
- Once successfully deployed, there will be a URL in the console to take you to where the project is deployed.
- If not, runï¼š
  - gcloud app browse
- Clean up to avoid billing charges: Project settings => shut down project

### Download, Build, & Run Instructions
First, clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/thatericchen/sustainable-commute-finder.git`.

#### Backend - Spring Boot Configuration

Navigate to the project root directory and execute

```
mvn clean install
gcloud app browse
```

#### Frontend - React

Navigate to `./frontend/` directory and execute

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available on http://localhost:5173.

## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
If you encounter issues while running the app, refer to the following common problems and their solutions.

### MongoDB Configuration
- **Problem:** The app is not connecting to the MongoDB instance when running locally.
- **Solution:** Ensure that you have a running MongoDB instance and place the connection link in the environmental variables. Use the format `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-address>` replacing `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster-address>` with your MongoDB credentials and address.

### Bug Fixes
- **Dropdown Menu Loading Issue**
  - **Problem:** The dropdown was not displaying all options.
  - **Solution:** Ensure the app is updated to the latest version where the data retrieval and rendering process is enhanced. Clear the browser cache or try a different browser if the issue persists.

- **UI Inconsistencies Across Devices**
  - **Problem:** The user interface isn't rendering consistently on all devices.
  - **Future Solution:** Adaptive UI has not been implemented yet, so this will be a future feature we can implement.

## Next Steps
Future development will focus on integrating real-time data sources such as traffic conditions, weather updates, and public transport schedules to provide users with accurate, dynamic carbon footprint calculations. This enhancement will ensure that users receive real-time estimates, making the information more relevant and actionable. Additionally, introducing custom user profiles will encourage long-term engagement by offering personalized insights and recommendations. Users will be able to track their progress over time, fostering a sustained commitment to reducing their carbon footprint during commutes.
